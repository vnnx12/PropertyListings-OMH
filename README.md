This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Property List with Next.js
This project showcases a property listing webpage built with Next.js. Properties can be displayed, sorted, and filtered by type. Users can also load more properties and scroll to the top with ease.

## Features
Display Properties: The main feature of the application is to display properties with their images, titles, descriptions, and prices.
Filter by Type: Users can filter properties by type (e.g., Studio, 1 Bedroom, 2 Bedrooms, etc.).
Sort by Price: Users can sort properties by price in ascending or descending order.
Load More: A button allows users to load more properties, if available.
Scroll to Top: A convenient button appears when the user scrolls down, allowing them to quickly return to the top of the page.
Mobile Responsive: The application is responsive and adjusts its layout according to the screen size.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
